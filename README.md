## Project realized by Ursula Vallejo Janne for the Course Gr√§nssnittsdesign.

**Project Summary**

This project involved redesigning the existing WordPress website for Gr√•bo Sportfiske & Fiskev√•rdsf√∂rening (the local fishing club) to improve its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). Starting from an analysis of the club‚Äôs current site and stakeholder needs, we defined four primary personas (local resident, retiree, tourist, long-term member) to guide content priorities and navigation. A Trello board was used to break down tasks and milestones throughout the process.

First, we created low-fidelity wireframes for mobile, tablet, and desktop to establish a consistent layout hierarchy: a prominent Hero section with logo and quick-access buttons (buy fishing permit, Swish donations), streamlined menu grouping (Home, News, About Fishing, Rules, Member), and a clear footer with emergency contact and club info. Next, a high-fidelity prototype was developed in Figma, refining typography (Oswald, Montserrat, Source Sans Pro), color palette (orange, gray, black, white), and iconography to align with the club‚Äôs existing branding. Throughout, we considered responsive behavior, accessibility for users with functional needs, and scenarios for each persona (e.g., international tourist seeking regulations and contact details). Finally, documentation was prepared to explain decisions around personas, fonts, colors, wireframes, and implementation challenges‚Äîsuch as responsive form fields and active menu states‚Äîand to evaluate potential improvements for future iterations.
